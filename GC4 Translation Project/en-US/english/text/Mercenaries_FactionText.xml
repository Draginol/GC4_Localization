        <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent. Much of their famous inventiveness is put into stopping slaveling revolts.</String>

        <String>The Terran 1st Fleet has returned from the pocket universe, and is tearing its way toward Earth. For the first time in 10 years, the mighty Drengin Empire has a foe worthy of fear, and has begun recalling their most powerful ships in an effort to stop the Terrans before it is too late.[BR][BR]The Torian people have seized this opportunity, and once again overthrown the newly weakened Drengin occupation forces from their home world, seizing the fleet for their own ends. Not one of their oppressors remains alive on Toria.[BR][BR]Envoys from the Arcean Empire and the Terran Alliance have arrived in the Torian space. Will they be the allies Toria need to stay free forever?</String>

        <String>The newly reborn Torian Regime has few assets, other than a small fleet of captured Drengin ships, and a willingness to work with just about anyone.</String>

        <String>The Arcean Empire was not left with many assets; just their home world and a few precious resources they liberated from the Drengin. They have come back from the brink, tougher, and more resilient than ever. [BR][BR]The Arcean people have a long history of nobility and neutrality, but the occupation has left them much less willing to forgive offenses or tolerate threats to their freedom.</String>
