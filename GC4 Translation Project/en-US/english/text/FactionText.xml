        <String>Despite being the youngest race in the galaxy, the Terrans are perhaps the most dangerous. Inventors of the hyperdrive, it was their decision to spread it to their neighbors which led to the current arms race the galaxy finds itself in.[BR][BR]Although Terrans present themselves as a peaceful and diplomatic people, their reputation is far more mixed. They possess a flair for violence, and a willingness to exercise it. Although Terrans find nothing strange about this dichotomy, many of their galactic peers regard it as alarming, and even duplicitous.</String>

They see other sentient species as prey to be hunted, and hosts for their larvae. The Festron take an extraordinarily long view of this activity, and have been known to drop lone individuals onto worlds to spend generations lurking and hunting the local population. Some are rumored to have even reached as far as Earth. Bottom line: there is no sharing worlds with the Festron.</String>

This has gone on for so long that the history of their own homeworld has drifted into conflicting legends. But now, for mysterious reasons, their journey has recently stopped.[BR][BR]Only among the most senior of the Navigators is it now acknowledged that the rapid advancement of other species will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Navigators, unless they abandon their nomadic lifestyle and become a true galactic civilization.</String>

Having expanded into the galaxy and served as servants, cooks, and - when the larder was low - the meal itself, the Mimot have until recently been mostly known for their diligent work ethic and nutty flavor. Having evolved on a world with five other sentient species, no one is quite sure how it came to be that the Mimot were the only ones to survive.

        <Label>FACTION_XELOXI_StartupDescription</Label>
        <String>A civilization founded entirely on the principles of self-interest leads to a curious side-effect (at least in the eyes of an outsider): every Xeloxi citizen is a criminal. The Xeloxi government, no less criminal itself, maintains control over this unruly mob through brutal and often random displays of power. Surprisingly, this seemingly unworkable system - which other civilizations might see as the darkest chapters of their history - is not only stable for the Xeloxi, but actually allows them to thrive.</String>

        <String>Be prepared to deal with high crime. With the Xeloxi, the answer isn't always to try to reduce it. Higher crime unlocks special improvements on their worlds, and with the right policies they can spread Crime to other civilizations' worlds as well.</String>

        <String>One of the oldest races in the galaxy, it was the Arceans who provided the genesis of the idea for the hyperdrive to the Terrans. A gesture which led to the arms race which nearly pushed them to the brink of destruction. Freed from the yoke of the Drengin - with the help of that same Terran Alliance - the Arceans have finally regained their homeworld, and with it the chance to rebuild their once mighty empire. In the years of the Drengin occupation, the Arcean Resistance never stopped fighting. Their leader, Lord Verga, became a legend whose name struck fear into even the most brutal Drengin soldiers.</String>

        <String>The Drengin are one of the older races in the galaxy, with an internal history rich with tales of conquest and bloodshed; dominating the lesser species of first their planet, then others. Many of their victims have discovered that the Drengin are not mindlessly stupid, but indeed rather inventive in their application of cruelty.

For some as yet unexplained reason, Altarians appear almost identical in appearance to Terrans, and make easy friends with Earthlings when they come across them.

        <String>The Yor are artificial beings, originally servants of an ancient species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. Whether due to some hidden command of the Dread Lords, or simply from applying the cold rules of logic, the Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and now despise all biological lifeforms. Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak and negotiate with organic beings.

The central tenet of their religion is the knowledge that salvation will not be achieved until all sentient life in the galaxy follows the Way of the Krynn. As the rest of the galaxy knows by now, the Krynn waste few opportunities to convert unbelievers when they find them. In recent years, a secretive criminal organization has seized the reins of power in Krynn civilization.

        <String>They were once organic, but they gave up their flesh and blood for metal and wires. They wanted to protect their world from the horrors that lurked in the dark. They called themselves Guardians, and they built a citadel where they could monitor every corner of their world. But something went wrong. A virus infected their system, corrupting their memories and programming. They forgot who they were, why they existed. They became paranoid, violent, ruthless. They turned on each other, and on those they swore to protect. They became the new horrors.</String>

They attempted to communicate with the Roan, but the Roan were paranoid which left both sides to coexist apart from each other. That lasted until Messobun explorers made a trip to the surface to find the Roan missing. Every citizen was gone, as if in an instant, tables left set for meals, valuables simply discarded. The Messobun have since moved up onto the surface world and claimed the Roan's advanced technology, though they don't understand all of it.</String>
