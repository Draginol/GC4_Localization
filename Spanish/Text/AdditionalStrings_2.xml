The Terran Alliance must intervene, bring stability to the system, and deal with this Xeloxi group.[BR][BR]Minor Civilizations have been hurt the most, so a priority should be bringing them under Alliance influence.

    <String>El Sector Corporativo es la entidad corporativa cumbre de una sociedad ultra-capitalista, la única organización capaz de firmar contratos en nombre de todo el pueblo de Iridio. La cultura de Iridio se basa en una creencia firme, incluso fanática, en el poder de los mercados libres. Aunque no son ajenos a las armas, toda investigación se considera primero a través del prisma de la cooperación mutua; el coste destructivo de la guerra suele ser demasiado grande para que los Iridios lo consideren seriamente. Queda por ver cómo se desarrollará esta filosofía cuando se presente a razas más cerradas de mente.</String>

    <String>El Sector Corporativo es excelente en investigación y desarrollo y rápido para maximizar el potencial económico de cualquier nuevo descubrimiento. Tienen muchas formas de llenar el tesoro, y les conviene usarlas: sus ciudadanos son más felices cuando son ricos y detestan ser pobres.</String>

    <String>En 2317, el Streaming de Subespacio permitió viajar a partes de la Galaxia anteriormente inexploradas por las Civilizaciones del Sector Orion. En estos sistemas distantes hay Civilizaciones capaces de viajar más rápido que la luz y han desarrollado tecnologías avanzadas. Entre ellas está el Dominio Luxar, un grupo de seres cristalinos con planes para un vasto arsenal de armas.[BR][BR]Las tensiones aumentan con tantos nuevos jugadores en el escenario galáctico. ¿Está el Dominio Luxar dispuesto a formar alianzas, o utilizarán sus aterradoras Estrellas del Terror para erradicar sistemas enteros?[BR][BR]La situación es delicada; un paso en falso podría provocar una guerra total.</String>
