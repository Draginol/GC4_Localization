    <Label>Entry_DrenginEmpire_Dec</Label>
    <String>The Drengin Empire embodies the quintessence of cosmic ambition. Towering at over 9 feet and brandishing an impressive set of razor-sharp teeth, their reputation in the galaxy is one of both awe and fear. The year 2226 marked a poignant chapter in their history, witnessing a civil confrontation with the Korath. And in this intricate dance of power, the Drengin, surprisingly, were the more measured participants.[BR][BR]The Drengin's creed is simple: the galaxy and all its non-Drengin inhabitants exist for their dominion. Their history with the Arceans is a testament to this belief. The joint invention of the stargates was a landmark of cooperation, swiftly followed by the Drengin's attempted betrayal. The ensuing debacle cemented a rivalry that remains fervent, even as stars burn out.[BR][BR]It would be an error to assume the Drengin's aggressiveness overshadows their intellect. Their technological marvels tread into areas many would deem ethically nebulous. Their persistence in galactic conquest is evident from their historical annals. When humanity was embroiled in terrestrial power struggles, the Drengin were engineering audacious mechanisms, like the ominous 'death furnaces', and undertaking expansive campaigns like the Torian enslavement.[BR][BR]Ironically, what held the Drengin back from universal domination was the vastness of space itself. Their venture to Toria, while grand, underscored the inefficiencies of their space travel. Humanity's invention of the hyperdrive, however, leveled the cosmic playing field. The initial human overtures, grounded in idealistic hopes of a united cosmos, were met with Drengin pragmatism in 2176. The ensuing silence from that human delegation speaks volumes, reminding us all that cosmic diplomacy, with the Drengin, comes with its own set of... challenges.</String>

    <String>Im Jahr 2317 ermöglichte Subspace-Streaming die Reise zu Teilen der Galaxie, die zuvor von den Zivilisationen des Orion-Sektors nicht kartiert wurden. In diesen entfernten Systemen gibt es Zivilisationen, die in der Lage sind, schneller als das Licht zu reisen und fortschrittliche Technologien entwickelt haben. Unter ihnen befindet sich das Luxar-Dominion, eine Gruppe von kristallinen Wesen mit Plänen für ein riesiges Waffenarsenal.[BR][BR]Die Spannungen steigen mit so vielen neuen Akteuren auf der galaktischen Bühne. Ist das Luxar-Dominion offen für die Bildung von Allianzen oder werden sie ihre erschreckenden Terrorsterne nutzen, um ganze Systeme auszulöschen?[BR][BR]Die Situation ist heikel; ein Fehltritt könnte zu einem allumfassenden Krieg führen.</String>

    <String>Die Terranische Allianz steht im Zentrum einer heiklen Situation. Ein Fehltritt könnte zu einem Krieg führen, der unzählige Tote hinterlässt.

    <String>Durch die Nutzung von Subspace-Streaming wurde Kontakt zu neuen Zivilisationen aufgenommen. Darunter befindet sich das Luxar-Dominion, das, wie die Terranische Allianz, unabhängig die Hyperantriebstechnologie entwickelt hat. Sie scheinen prominent und mächtig zu sein.[BR][BR]Die Terranische Allianz befindet sich nun in einer heiklen Situation. Ihre Handlungen können das Verhältnis zwischen den verschiedenen Zivilisationen prägen. Ein falscher Schritt hier könnte zu einem verheerenden Krieg führen.[BR][BR]Die Terranische Allianz muss ihren Einfluss nutzen, um den Frieden zu bewahren und gesunde Beziehungen zu formen.</String>

Ein gewisser Konflikt mag erforderlich sein, sollte aber wann immer möglich beruhigt und vermieden werden. Alles außer einem Einflusssieg hier bedroht das Leben in der gesamten Galaxie.</String>

    <String>2317, das Jahr, in dem der Orion-Sektor einen völlig neuen Teil der Galaxie kontaktiert.

    <String>2317, inmitten des Aufruhrs, kehrt der Korath Clan zurück. Der Korath Clan war in dem Drengin Reich als Stoßtruppen legendär. Sie waren oft an der Spitze eines jeden Angriffs und für ihre Wildheit und Grausamkeit bekannt. Der Korath Clan glaubte, dass alles Leben den Drengin unterlegen und unwürdig des Lebens war. Sie glaubten, dass alles Schwache aus dem Universum ausgelöscht werden sollte, was stark von der Tendenz des Drengin Reichs abwich, Gruppen, die sie als minderwertig ansahen, zu versklaven. Die dadurch verursachten philosophischen Unterschiede führten dazu, dass der Korath Clan sich vom Reich löste. Der Korath Clan wurde noch bemerkenswerter, nachdem ihr Kontakt mit den Dread Lords sie körperlich veränderte. Der Korath Clan glaubt, dass sie die wahren Drengin sind und streben danach, alle anderen auszulöschen, sogar das Reich, dem sie einst dienten.</String>
