        <String>The Terran Alliance has been formed by United Earth to explore space and colonize new planets. This project has been made possible by the development of faster-than-light travel. Approaching the galaxy warrants caution. If the natural dangers of the cosmos weren't enough, there might be aliens. [BR][BR]It's been some time since humanity last contacted the Arceans or the Korx, leaving them alone in the galaxy once more. It may only be a matter of time before discovering other alien groups. Until then, it's up to the Terran Alliance and its commander, DL Bradley, to secure the sector in the name of humanity.</String>
