Still, we have identified three potential locations for colonies on the planet.[BR][BR]Ares Vallis is where Sojourner, the first Terran explorer outside of Earth, landed.[BR][BR]Eberswalde Delta is a delta in a delta.[BR][BR]Holden Crater has signs of microbial life that may indicate that the region is more suited for organic life.[BR][BR]Where would you like to build our colony?</String>

        <String>{PLANETNAME} is as inhospitable as we have seen so far. It is cold, barren and has a limited atmosphere and gravity. Still, our colony is deployed successfully and our colonists quickly set to turning this minor planet into a new home. It is an example of what our courage and ingenuity are able to accomplish. One corporation is very interested in {PLANETNAME} and offers a generous fee if we will allow them exclusive licensing rights to the fledgling colony.</String>
