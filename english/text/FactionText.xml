        <String>Despite being the youngest race in the galaxy, the Terrans are perhaps the most dangerous. Inventors of the hyperdrive, it was their decision to spread it to their neighbors which led to the current arms race the galaxy finds itself in.[BR][BR]Although Terrans present themselves as a peaceful and diplomatic people, their reputation is far more mixed. They possess a flair for violence, and a willingness to exercise it. Although Terrans find nothing strange about this dichotomy, many of their galactic peers regard it as alarming, and even duplicitous.</String>

The Festron take an extraordinarily long view of this activity, and have been known to drop lone individuals onto worlds to spend generations lurking and hunting the local population.

        <String>The Mimot have evolved to the point that they no longer resemble their original body-forms in the slightest. Having expanded into the galaxy and served as servants, cooks, and - when the larder was low - the meal itself, the Mimot have until recently been mostly known for their diligent work ethic and nutty flavor. Having evolved on a world with five other sentient species, no one is quite sure how it came to be that the Mimot were the only ones to survive.

        <Label>FACTION_XELOXI_StartupDescription</Label>
        <String>A civilization founded entirely on the principles of self-interest leads to a curious side-effect (at least in the eyes of an outsider): every Xeloxi citizen is a criminal. The Xeloxi government, no less criminal itself, maintains control over this unruly mob through brutal and often random displays of power. Surprisingly, this seemingly unworkable system - which other civilizations might see as the darkest chapters of their history - is not only stable for the Xeloxi, but actually allows them to thrive.</String>

        <String>One of the oldest races in the galaxy, it was the Arceans who provided the genesis of the idea for the hyperdrive to the Terrans. A gesture which led to the arms race which nearly pushed them to the brink of destruction. Freed from the yoke of the Drengin - with the help of that same Terran Alliance - the Arceans have finally regained their homeworld, and with it the chance to rebuild their once mighty empire. In the years of the Drengin occupation, the Arcean Resistance never stopped fighting.

        <String>The Drengin are one of the older races in the galaxy, with an internal history rich with tales of conquest and bloodshed; dominating the lesser species of first their planet, then others. Many of their victims have discovered that the Drengin are not mindlessly stupid, but indeed rather inventive in their application of cruelty. There are few ways to devour a slaveling that the Drengin haven't thought up. However, simple beatings are usually the most economically prudent option for slaveling discipline.</String>

Kind and generous to a fault, their unique history means Altarians are prone to a certain degree of self-righteousness when they find themselves dealing with other, lesser races. For some as yet unexplained reason, Altarians appear almost identical in appearance to Terrans, and make easy friends with Earthlings when they come across them.

        <String>The Yor are artificial beings, originally servants of an ancient species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. Whether due to some hidden command of the Dread Lords, or simply from applying the cold rules of logic, the Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and now despise all biological lifeforms. Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak and negotiate with organic beings.

        <String>The first united technical achievement of the Manti was the creation of a great beacon tower, designed to announce their presence to the unknown. A few days after turning it on an answer was received: a fleet of warships appearing in orbit; raiders arriving en masse to collect every child on the planet. An entire generation, lost. Humiliated at their unsophisticated thinking, the surviving Manti and the generations that followed, began exploring space on their own. They were motivated by their fear that the raiders would return, eager to some day confront them, and find the children that were stolen.</String>

The central tenet of their religion is the knowledge that salvation will not be achieved until all sentient life in the galaxy follows the Way of the Krynn. As the rest of the galaxy knows by now, the Krynn waste few opportunities to convert unbelievers when they find them. In recent years, a secretive criminal organization has seized the reins of power in Krynn civilization.

        <String>Contrary to the assumptions of uninformed galactic citizens, the Orphic Prime unit puppeteering the so-called "Orphic Enclave" is not a sentient artificial intelligence. An ancient experiment in genetic programming algorithms gone hellishly wrong, the long-extinct inhabitants of Orpheus have since had their brain matter repurposed by the creature, expanding its computational power to godlike proportions. Recently, the Orphic Prime unit has learned to exploit the galactic tourism industry: individuals are plugged in to perfect virtual reality, while the idle portions of their mind add to the Prime unit's power.</String>

        <String>They were once organic, but they gave up their flesh and blood for metal and wires. They wanted to protect their world from the horrors that lurked in the dark. They called themselves Guardians, and they built a citadel where they could monitor every corner of their world. But something went wrong. A virus infected their system, corrupting their memories and programming. They forgot who they were, why they existed. They became paranoid, violent, ruthless. They turned on each other, and on those they swore to protect. They became the new horrors.</String>

They attempted to communicate with the Roan, but the Roan were paranoid which left both sides to coexist apart from each other. That lasted until Messobun explorers made a trip to the surface to find the Roan missing. Every citizen was gone, as if in an instant, tables left set for meals, valuables simply discarded. The Messobun have since moved up onto the surface world and claimed the Roan's advanced technology, though they don't understand all of it.</String>
