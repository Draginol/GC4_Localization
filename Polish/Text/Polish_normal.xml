    <String>The year is 2307. The Drengin Empire once dominated this part of the galaxy. All other races served as slaves. The Empire was destined to last forever. But then, the diplomats of Sol III organized a rebellion and overturned Drengin dominance.[BR][BR]The once glorious Drengin Empire was reduced to a single star system. The home system remained untouched. The humans and their allies will not keep the Empire suppressed![BR][BR]Space is quite vast. In the Utha sector, worlds are untouched—a fresh start.

Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak and negotiate with organic beings.

    <String>The Corporate Sector is the apex corporate entity of an ultra-capitalistic society, the only organization capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the entire Iridium people. The Iridium culture is based on a firm, even fanatical belief in the power of free markets. Although no strangers to weaponry, all research is first considered through the lens of mutual cooperation; the destructive cost of warfare is often too great for Iridiums to seriously consider. It remains to be seen how well this philosophy will fare when introduced to more close-minded races.</String>

    <String>Kolonizatorzy na {PLANETNAME} zaczęli hodować i organizować wyścigi miejscowego gatunku niskich, czteronożnych zwierząt. Surowa grawitacja na tej planecie sprawia, że wyścigi są szczególnie wyczerpujące, a nagrania z rannymi zwierzętami spowodowały, że obrońcy praw zwierząt z całej galaktyki domagają się zakończenia tej barbarzyńskiej praktyki. Ale stało się to dużą częścią lokalnej kultury, a kolonizatorzy nie będą zadowoleni, jeśli zakończymy wyścigi. Jakie są Twoje rozkazy?</String>

    <String>{PLANETNAME} jest tak niegościnne, jak dotąd widzieliśmy. Jest zimno, jałowo, atmosfera i grawitacja są ograniczone. Mimo to nasza kolonia została pomyślnie rozmieszczona, a nasi koloniści szybko przystąpili do przekształcania tej niewielkiej planety w nowy dom. Jest to przykład tego, co nasza odwaga i pomysłowość są w stanie osiągnąć. Jedna korporacja jest bardzo zainteresowana {PLANETNAME} i oferuje hojne wynagrodzenie, jeśli pozwolimy im na wyłączne prawa do licencji na młodą kolonię.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_DURANTIUM_DESC</Label>
    <String>Nasi górnicy wrócili z kamiennymi szczątkami przeplatane migotliwym błyskiem srebrzysto-złotym: Durantium. Jest to materiał gęstszy i bardziej wytrzymały niż cokolwiek, co widzieliśmy wcześniej, stałe dostawy z pewnością doprowadzą do nowych przełomów w projektowaniu statków.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_ELERIUM_DESC</Label>
    <String>Nienaturalny blask wypełnia statek górniczy, gdy pobiera pierwszą partię tajemniczej substancji, Elerium. Jest to materiał, który wydaje się wzmacniać systemy o wysokiej energii.

  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_PROMETHION_DESC</Label>
    <String>Pierwsza grupa naszych sond powróciła z kapsułami zawierającymi śladowe ilości Promethionu. Śladowe ilości z konieczności, ponieważ materiał ten jest niesamowicie niestabilny. Okaże się niezbędny dla naszych wysiłków badawczych w szerokim zakresie zastosowań.</String>

    <String>Pierwsza Kopalnia Tulitu</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_THULIUM_DESC</Label>
    <String>Tul jest niepozorny, zaskakująco matowy zarówno w teksturze, jak i kolorze. Dopiero w wyższych wymiarach ujawnia swój prawdziwy charakter, stabilną formę Neutronium, materiału o ogromnej gęstości. Będzie to kluczowy składnik dla wielu nowych systemów.</String>

    <String>Pierwsza z naszych sond do wydobycia antymaterii (niewiele więcej niż silnik ze łyżką) wraca z peryferii czarnej dziury ze swoim cennym ładunkiem. Zebrana antymateria wkrótce zostanie wykorzystana do rozwijania zaawansowanych systemów broni i generacji energii.</String>

    <String>Z minimalnym ceremoniałem, pierwsza z twoich fregat handlowych odpycha się od swojego slipu. Kiedy wróci, będzie zawierać niewielką część bogactwa galaktyki, pierwszą w co z pewnością będzie długą serią dochodowych wymian dla twojego ludu.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_STARBASE_DESC</Label>
    <String>Nasi ludzie już wcześniej budowali stałe struktury w przestrzeni kosmicznej, ale nic takiego jak to. Ta baza kosmiczna to rozszerzenie naszej cywilizacji. Wszystko, co robimy, wszystko, kim jesteśmy, można znaleźć tutaj. Z pewnością to z niej rozszerzymy naszą cywilizację jeszcze dalej.</String>

    <String>Pierwsze Badanie Anomalii</String>
  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_ANOMALY_DESC</Label>
    <String>Nasz statek badawczy ostrożnie zbliża się do tajemniczego obiektu, wszystkie czujniki ustawione na maksymalne wzmocnienie. Jedna z wielu tajemnic wszechświata, być może wielkie niebezpieczeństwo lub cenny skarb, wkrótce zostanie nam ujawniona.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_SUBSPACE_STREAM_TRAVEL_DESC</Label>
    <String>Za sprawą błysku i sztuczki fizyki, statek zniknął, podróżując dalej i szybciej niż ktokolwiek z naszej rasy podróżował wcześniej. Dzisiaj, galaktyka stała się znacznie, znacznie mniejsza.</String>

    <String>Nie każda planeta, którą znajdziemy, będzie pusta; wiemy o tym od jakiegoś czasu. Ale dzisiaj jest pierwszym dniem, kiedy próbujemy zabrać jedną od kogoś innego. Dzisiaj zapisze się jako zwycięstwo, które z pewnością będziemy świętować przez długi czas.</String>

  </StringTable>
  <StringTable>
    <Label>FIRST_GOVERNMENT_UPGRADE_DESC</Label>
    <String>Nasz naród wypowiedział się, i choć niektórzy mogą wątpić w mądrość, nikt nie będzie wątpił w proces. Nasz nowy rząd otrzymał jasny mandat. Życzmy im wszystkiego najlepszego, bo ich porażka stanie się naszą.</String>

    <String>Odczyty skanera są niejednoznaczne, ale jedno jest pewne: ten obiekt jest stary. Kiedy nasze sondy manewrują wokół tego dziwnego urządzenia, staje się jasne, że istoty, które to stworzyły, były o wiele potężniejsze i doświadczone niż my. To przywilej, nawet patrzeć na ich pracę.</String>

Nie pozostał żywy żaden z ich oprawców na Torii.[BR][BR]Posłańcy z Imperium Arcean i Sojuszu Terańskiego przybyli do przestrzeni kosmicznej Torian.
