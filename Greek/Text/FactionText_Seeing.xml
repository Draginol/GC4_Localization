		<String>The Intueri develop as quickly as those they watch. They can easily comprehend and replicate things they witness; however, their lack of creative thought and ability to problem solve impacts their ability to make their own discoveries.[BR][BR]The collective consciousness of the Intueri had been stagnant for nearly a millennia until they made contact with the Luxar. After first gazing upon their star ships and faster-than-light drives, the Intueri quickly took to the stars. Now they search far and wide for the knowledge of others to expand their own intelligence.</String>

		<String>The Intueri's have high exploration and sensor range, enabling them to quickly map out the galaxy. To compensate for their low Research rate the Intueri have the Cosmic Eye, a powerful tool that allows them to steal technology and research from other civilizations.</String>
